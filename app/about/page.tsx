            As a self-studied Full Stack Developer, I spent much time and energy
            breaking into the world of software development. Then, life took an
            exciting turn when I embraced the incredible experience of
            motherhood, which led to a career change and the inspiration to
            start this blog.

            About three years ago, I started as a software engineer in a dynamic
            100-person start-up. I loved this role, and I learned invaluable
            skills in adaptability, problem-solving, and accomplishing tasks
            swiftly and efficiently. About three years ago, I started as a

            Then, becoming a mother prompted me to deeply reflect on the role I
            wanted my career to play in my life. Bid farewell to on-call shifts
            and late-night bug fixing, I found a new role that allows me to
            cherish precious moments with my family while immersing myself in
            exciting projects and collaborating with talented professionals.

            Now, I'm a Technical Writer at Microsoft, working to distill
            intricate concepts into user-friendly content. Working alongside
            strong engineers, driven product managers, and creative content
            developers, I learn a lot every day at work. My work and personal
            life merge to create the insights and experience that come through
            in this blog.

            Through my story, I aspire to inspire those navigating their own
            career paths or seeking a harmonious work-life integration. To do
            this, you need the right tools, knowledge, and support. I firmly
            believe in the power of embracing change, pursuing passions, and
            finding creative ways to achieve your goals while prioritizing what
            truly matters.

            sharing my experiences and insights with you.
